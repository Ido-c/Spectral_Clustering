# Form the weighted adjacency matrix W

# Compute the normalized graph Laplacian and Lnorm

# Determine k and obtain the first k eigenvectors of Lnorm

# Let U be the matrix containing the vectors u1; : : : ; uk as columns

# Form the matrix T  from U by renormalizing each of U's rows to have unit length

# Treating each row of T as a point in Rk, cluster them into k clusters via the K-means algorithm

# Assign the original point xi to cluster j if and only if row i of the matrix T was assigned to cluster j
